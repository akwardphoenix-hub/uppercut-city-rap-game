# Frozen Documentation Files
# These files are the source of truth and should NOT be auto-regenerated
# to prevent CI loops and ensure stable builds

## Core Documentation
- README.md
- SETUP.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- NETWORK_BLOCKING_FIXES.md

## GitHub Instructions
- .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Configuration Files
- scripts/pre-publish-check.sh

## CI Stability Rules
1. CI must never leave the repo dirty (git status must be clean after build/test)
2. Pre-publish script (scripts/pre-publish-check.sh) only lints, builds, and runs tests
3. Documentation should only be updated manually by maintainers, never auto-regenerated in CI
4. Do NOT add .github/copilot-setup.yml or copilot-setup-steps.yml files
5. Keep all regeneration logic OUTSIDE CI - CI = pure validation only

## Note
If you need to regenerate documentation, use a manual script AFTER verifying
that tests pass. Never add automatic documentation regeneration to CI pipelines
or pre-publish scripts to avoid infinite loops.
